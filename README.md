**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself? 
  For project two I was given the .py files necessary as well as a majority of the notbook completed for me. THis includes printing of the model and the tests needed to test the algorithim. I created a deep Q learning algorithim to train my pirate agent. 
**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists are professionals who focus on the theoretical foundations and practical applications of computing technology. They work on solving complex problems related to the development and optimization of algorithms, software, and systems that process and analyze data. Their work spans a wide range of domains, from designing algorithms that make processes more efficient to creating software that powers everything from video games to critical infrastructure systems.
**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
The first thing that I do is to understand the problem that I am given. Next, I will research and gather the infomration. Next, I will create a plan of action. Then I will Design the solution and then implement the solution. Then I will test and debug the program. Lastly, from those results I will iterate and imporve the program. 
**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As a computer scientist, your ethical responsibilities to both the end user and the organization are critical to maintaining trust, ensuring fairness, and delivering high-quality products or services. These responsibilities span various aspects of design, development, data handling, security, privacy, and more.
